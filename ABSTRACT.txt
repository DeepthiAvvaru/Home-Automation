**ABSTRACT**

Home automation using embedded systems has gained increasing popularity in 
recent years, as it provides users with a more convenient and efficient way of managing 
their homes. Embedded systems, which are small computers embedded in devices, are 
used to control various aspects of the home such as lighting, heating, security, and 
entertainment systems. In this paper we present an abstract for home automation using 
embedded systems, focusing on the system architecture, hardware and software 
components, and their interactions. The abstract describes the use of sensors for data 
collection and control, and microcontrollers for processing and decision-making. 
The project is implemented with the help of NodeMCU which have an inbuilt Wi-Fi module 
and the home appliances are connected to 4 channel relay modules. Wireless connection 
is created for communication between the NodeMCU and the Android application. By this 
way we can operate the home appliances like fans, lights and AC etc. The benefits of 
using embedded systems for home automation, including energy savings, increased 
security, and improved quality of life for users.


**INTRODUCTION**

A brand-new method of electronically operating household equipment is called 
"home automation." The phrases "Smart House" and "Intelligent Home" are used to 
describe this kind of system and to present the idea of networking household equipment 
and gadgets. The study of home automation systems (HASs) offers a significant chance to 
develop new disciplines in engineering, architecture, and computer. The design of a home 
automation system involves a number of difficulties. The system must be scalable in order 
for additional devices to be quickly added. On the host side, it should offer a user-friendly 
interface to enable configuration, monitoring, and management of the devices. It would 
need to be affordable for the method to be widely used.
Generally, in offices of public and private sector companies, most people are not 
interested in switching off consumer electronic appliances like fans, lights, etc. if they are 
not present. Power consumption in the home tends to rise as more consumer electronics 
and home appliances are used and as their sizes expand. Furthermore, when they don't 
carry out the main duty, they utilize energy ineffectively.
For the convenience of consumers, home automation is a technique for automatically 
regulating household equipment. The usage of equipment in accordance with precise 
guidelines makes life easier for the user and conserves energy. Controls can be as simple 
as setting up a network of household appliances that can be controlled remotely or as 
sophisticated as dimming lights using a remote control.
Home automation has several advantages, including increased comfort, security, 
convenience, and energy efficiency. By automatically adjusting lighting, heating, and 
cooling systems based on occupancy and environmental factors, home automation 
systems can aid in reducing energy consumption. They can also give homeowners more 
protection by allowing them to remotely monitor their properties and get notifications in the 
event of suspicious behaviour. Ultimately, by making our homes smarter, more effective, 
and more comfortable, home automation has the potential to completely change how we 
live there.


**BLYNK APP**

Install the Blynk app from the Play store on your smartphone. Start the programme, Gmail 
or Facebook may be used to sign up or login. Now pick the new project option to start a 
new project and give it a name, such as home automation. Next, click the plus button to 
add a switch to the work area. Once the switch has been added, click on it to configure it. 
The output of the NodeMCU will then be selected by selecting the Output pins to Digital 
pin number (Gp 0 to Gp 16). Choose the Pins that connect to Relays. 
Finally, we added a feedback circuit to the nodeMCU to track the appliances' state 
(whether they are on or off). A 220-volt AC-DC converter was employed for this feedback 
circuit. NodeMCU could only operate at 3.3 volts. Hence, a voltage division rule was used 
to lower the 220V voltage to 3V or 3.3V
